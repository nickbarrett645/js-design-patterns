# js-design-patterns

## Summary

This repo implements each chapter of the [Pro JavaScript Design Patterns](https://jsdesignpatterns.com/).

Parts of this book are old and outdated given the advancements of ES6 and TypeScript, but practicing never hurt anyone especially when it helps you understand how far JavaScript has come.

The plan will be to implement all the examples using just pre ES6 JavaScript and then go back and use TypeScript

You can run the individual examples using node.
